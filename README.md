# Weather-Analysis

## This purpose of this report is to analyze the relationship between the Latitudinal positioning of a city and its weather

### The following code utilizes an Open Weather Map API to gather weather data from over 500 cities around the world.

### The data is cleaned and compiled into dataframes in three groupings:
1. The world
2. The Northern Hemisphere
3. The Southern Hemisphere

### The dataframes are used to make scatter plots and scatter/linear regression plots comparing cities' Latitudes to four weather categories:
1. Maximum Temperature in Fahrenheit
2. Humidity (%)
3. Cloudiness (%)
4. Wind Speed (mph)

### After each single or pair of related plots an analytical explanation is provided

### The utilized dataframe is saved to this folder as a CSV, along with PNG images of the plots
